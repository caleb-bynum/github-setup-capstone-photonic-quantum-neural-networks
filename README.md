# README

## Introduction

This project focuses on the creation of a 4-qumode classifier harnessing the power of a hybrid quantum-classical neural network. By combining classical dense layers constructed with Keras and quantum layers developed with PennyLane, this project offers a novel approach to classification tasks.

## Requirements

For a seamless setup and execution, ensure the following are installed:

- Anaconda or Miniconda

## Setup with Conda

1. If you haven't installed Anaconda or Miniconda, download and install it from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
2. Open your terminal or Anaconda prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you've cloned the repository:

```
cd path_to_directory
```

4. Use the provided `environment.yml` file to create a Conda environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

5. Activate the newly created environment:

```
conda activate qumode_classifier
```

## Installation

Clone this code repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/FA23-CSCE482-capstone-classroom/github-setup-capstone-photonic-quantum-neural-networks.git
```

```

## Execute Code

1. Ensure you're in the project's root directory.
2. Activate the Conda environment:

```
conda activate qumode_classifier
```

3. Run the main script or the specific module of interest:

```
python 4_qumode_classifier.py
```

## Deployment

Detailed deployment instructions using Conda are outlined in the "Setup with Conda" section.

## Support

Official support for this application has concluded. While no further pivotal development is on the horizon, the potential remains to scale and generalize the application for more extensive applicability in the future.
